<h1>About</h1>

<p>No one likes paying ATM surcharges, so why do we do it? Because no one
  person has the time or inclination to track the every surcharge in
  every place, and the banks certainly aren't going to help. But what if we
  teamed up and shared this information with our neighbors? That's what
  <em>No Sur!</em> is all about.</p>

<p>Explore the map to find ATMs near you so you always get the best deal
  without wasting time. Already been cheated by an ATM? Use <em>No Sur!</em>
  to add that ATM and surcharge to the map to help others out.</p>

<p><em>No Sur!</em> is powered by <a href="http://shareabouts.org">Shareabouts</a>,
  a mapping project from <a href="http://openplans.org/civicworks">OpenPlans</a>.</p>
